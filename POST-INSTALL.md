## Installing git-peek

You'll need to have [`git-peek`](https://github.com/jarred-sumner/git-peek) installed for this to work and only macOS is supported for now.

To do that, run this:

```bash
npm install -g @jarred/git-peek
```

Next, you'll need to register the `git-peek://` URL handler. Just run this:

```bash
git peek -r
```

Then, head over to the test page:
